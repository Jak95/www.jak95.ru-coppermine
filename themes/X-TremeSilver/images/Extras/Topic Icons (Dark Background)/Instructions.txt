1) Just copy the folder "images" in your root directory of forum 
    (it will ask you to replace, in fact that's happend because it finds same directory-
      it doesn't replace anything at all so don't be afraid of loosing your icons)

2) Go to your ACP-->Posting-->Topic Icons 

   and click where it says "Install Icons Package"!

It will automatically find the "icons.pak" and you can just press "install icon packages"

That's it!!!Enjoy brand new top quality (dark background) matching topic Icons!!!!!
